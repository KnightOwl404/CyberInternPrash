# Assignment 6 - Proof of Concept (POC)

This repository contains my research, experimentation, and POC developed using the allotted security tools.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Tool 1: Hex2dec - A command-line tool for converting hexadecimal to decimal (and vice versa), often used in memory and binary analysis.
- Tool 2: NotMyFault - A Sysinternals tool used to deliberately crash systems or trigger system faults, helpful for testing crash dump analysis and Blue Screen debugging procedures.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To study and demonstrate real-world malware analysis and memory investigation concepts such as:
- Converting hex values from memory dumps
- Generating and analyzing system crash dumps using deliberate faults
