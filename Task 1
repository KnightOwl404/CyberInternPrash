Task 1
 What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that helps developers manage and collaborate on code using Git, a distributed version control system. It allows multiple developers to work on projects simultaneously without interfering with each other’s changes.

🔑 Key GitHub Concepts
Repository (Repo): A storage space for your project, including code, files, and history.


Commit: A snapshot of changes made to files.


Branch: A separate version of the code for developing features independently.


Merge: Combines code from different branches.


Pull Request (PR): A request to merge code changes, typically reviewed by others.


Fork: A personal copy of someone else’s repository to experiment with.


Clone: Copies a repository from GitHub to your local computer.


Push: Sends your local changes to the GitHub server.


Pull: Downloads the latest changes from GitHub to your local machine.



🔧 Basic Git Commands
git init             # Start a new Git repository
git clone <url>      # Download a repository from GitHub
git status           # Check the current state of your repository
git add <file>       # Stage a file for commit
git commit -m "msg"  # Save your staged changes with a message
git push             # Send committed changes to GitHub
git pull             # Get the latest changes from GitHub


🖥️ Part 2: Basic Linux Commands
Linux is an open-source operating system commonly used in software development. Knowing basic Linux commands is essential for navigating and managing files through the terminal.

📂 File and Directory Commands
pwd            # Show current directory
ls             # List files and folders
cd <dir>       # Change to another directory
mkdir <name>   # Create a new directory
touch <file>   # Create a new empty file
cp <src> <dst> # Copy a file or folder
mv <src> <dst> # Move or rename files
rm <file>      # Delete a file
rmdir <dir>    # Delete an empty directory


📄 Viewing and Editing Files
cat <file>     # View file contents
less <file>    # Scroll through file contents
nano <file>    # Open a file for editing using Nano editor


⚙️ System and Process Management
top            # Display real-time system processes
ps             # Show running processes
kill <pid>     # Terminate a process using its PID


🔎 Helpful Tools

man <command>  # Display manual/help for a command
history        # Show previously used commands
clear          # Clear the terminal screen


 Summary
GitHub is a collaborative platform that uses Git to manage version control.


Linux commands allow efficient file and system management via the terminal.


Understanding both tools is essential for developers and system administrators.
